            <p>In 2023, WCAG 2.2 introduced a handful of <b>new success criteria</b>.</p>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>There are three criteria that fall under the principle of <b>making products “Understandable”</b>:</p>

          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>When users are completing a task on our site or app, we need to <b>ensure that they can find help consistently</b> when they need it.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>This is particularly important for people with <b>cognitive variations or vision impairments</b>.</p>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>They may also be forced to <b>seek assistance</b> from other people.</p>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>This may involve sharing personal information, which could be a <b>security or privacy risk</b>.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p><b>Success Criterion 3.2.6 Consistent Help</b> mandates that any help mechanism must be in a consistent location across your product.</p>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>This includes the <b>visual location</b> as well as the <b>location for assistive technologies</b> like screen readers.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>This applies to <b>any mechanism of help</b>.</p>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>Whether it’s <b>finding a phone number or email address</b>, accessing a contact form, reading an FAQ page, or activating a chatbot.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>For example, a website offers <b>help links to a contact form</b> and social media channels.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>These links are in the footer, which means they're <b>consistently located across the site</b>.</p>

            <p>By providing this consistency, we make it easier for customers to <b>locate the help they need in a timely manner</b>.</p>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>On the Salesforce website, the ‘Contact Us’ feature <b>remains in the top right corner</b>.</p>

            <p>What is <b>Success Criterion 3.3.7 Redundant Entry</b> about?</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>Making sure a person doesn't have to <b>manually enter the same information more than once</b> while they're completing a process.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>This will reduce both the <b>mental and physical effort</b> for users.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>It’s particularly important for people with <b>limited cognitive or physical energy</b>, or with limited memory, focus, or dexterity.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>A common example of repeated information is when a person is asked for a <b>billing and shipping address</b> at checkout.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>Often, a person's billing and shipping address <b>are the same</b>.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>There are a few methods we can use to <b>prevent redundant entry</b> and reduce the effort required:</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>1. Allow <b>copy-paste</b> on the form fields.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>2. Allow people to fill in information from a <b>drop-down list</b>.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>3. Enable <b>autofill</b> to complete the information.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>4. Provide a <b>‘Copy information in x field’</b> mechanism (such as a ‘Billing address is same as shipping address’ checkbox).</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>We <b>do not need to prevent redundant entry</b> in the following scenarios:</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>1. Information related to <b>security</b> (such as a password).</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>2. Information that has <b>expired and needs re-entry</b> (such as a credit card).</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>3. And information that must be re-entered for the <b>purpose of the exercise</b> (such as a game).</p>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <h3>Accessible Authentication</h3>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>Authentication asks people to prove their identity in <b>multiple ways to improve security</b>.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p><b>Success Criterion 3.3.8 Accessible Authentication (Minimum)</b> will ensure login methods are accessible and easy to use, as well as secure.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>On salesforce.com today, the <b>TBID</b> is used for authentication.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>This stands for <b>"Trusted Broker ID"</b> authentication.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>Generally, this should mean that we do not have to <b>create our own authentication solution</b>.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>If you do, please <b>carefully review</b> the following guidance.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>An accessible login method doesn't require people to <b>remember, transcribe, or solve information without help</b>.</p>
          </section> 

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>These are considered cognitive function tests, and they can make logging in <b>very difficult for some people</b>.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>We’ll go through <b>each example now</b>.</p>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>Transcription is a common feature of <b>two factor authentication</b>.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>For example, when a user is given a code that they must <b>manually input into a verification text field</b>, or a word-based CAPTCHA to transcribe.</p>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>If we must use it, we should allow users to enter the data <b>in a way that does not involve transcription</b>, such as:</p>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p><b>Puzzles</b> are often used in CAPTCHA-based authentication.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>These methods require a person to <b>solve a math equation, drag a shape into place, or match two items</b>.</p>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>However, many kinds of people may have trouble solving puzzles, due to their <b>cognition, vision, or dexterity</b>.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>Because of this, most kinds of puzzles are <b>not permitted under this criterion</b>.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>There are <b>two kinds of puzzle that are acceptable</b> under the “Minimum” (AA) version of this criterion:</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>1. <b>Object recognition</b>, such as selecting all cars in a set of images.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>2. <b>Personal content recognition</b>, where a person can upload their own non-text content, like a photo, and then identify it from a set of options.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>If necessary, Salesforce can use Google reCAPTCHA, which is <b>an acceptable ‘object recognition’ puzzle</b>.</p>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>Keep in mind this type of CAPTCHA isn't going to work for <b>people with no or limited vision</b>.</p>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>Now that we've broken down our main requirements, we can also consider providing <b>an alternative login method</b> that is not a cognitive function test.</p>
