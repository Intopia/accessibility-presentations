    <h2 id="what">What are screen readers?</h2>

    <p>Screen readers are assistive technologies that help specific groups of people to access digital content.</p>

    <p>Screen readers are designed to convert web page content into either of the following:</p>

    <ul class="icon-list">
      <li><span aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-check"></span>Synthesised speech so that users can listen to the content.</li>
      <li><span aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-check"></span>Braille so that users can read the content as braille output.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Since the majority of screen reader users don’t use a mouse, almost all screen readers use a wide variety of keyboard commands to carry out different tasks.</p>

    <p>There is a common misconception that screen readers &lsquo;read what’s on the screen&rsquo;.</p>

    <p>In reality, screen readers interact with a version of the page source code, referred to as the Accessibility Tree.</p>

    <p>Another common misconception is that screen readers are only used by people who are fully blind.</p>

    <p>In fact, lots of different types of people use screen readers including:

    <ul class="icon-list">
      <li><span aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-check"></span>People with no vision</li>
      <li><span aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-check"></span>People with reduced vision</li>
      <li><span aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-check"></span>People with reading issues such as dyslexia</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="types">Types of screen readers?</h2>

    <p>There are a wide range of screen readers across different operating systems, including the following:</p>

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Operating System</th>
          <th>Screen Reader</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>

          <td>Windows</td>

    <h2 id="how">How screen reader users navigate</h2>

    <p>Screen reader users navigate around web pages in different ways depending on their need. This includes:</p>

    <h4>1. Reading the page from top to bottom</h4>
    <p>This is done by allowing the screen reader to announce all content on the page.</p>

    <h4>2. Skimming through content</h4>
    <p>This is done by skimming over content, jumping onto the next line before the current line has finished being announced.</p>

    <h4>3. Keyboard shortcuts</h4>
    <p>Using keyboard shortcuts to navigate around the page, via Headings, Links, Forms, Buttons, Tables, Landmarks, Lists and more.</li>

    <h4>4. Search</h4>
    <p>Search for specific information within the page using either:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Browser-based search functionality.</li>
      <li>Specific search functionality within the screen reader.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>5. Focusable elements</h4>
    <p>Using <kbd>TAB</kbd> keystrokes to navigate around the website or web app via focusable elements. This is most commonly used in forms.</p>

    <h2>Common keyboard-only pain points:</h2>

    <h4>1. Lack of keyboard-only access</h4>
    <p>Users cannot access key site functionality without full keyboard access.</p>

    <h4>2. Inability to bypass blocks</h4>
    <p>Users cannot quickly navigate to locations in web pages, and have to listen to every focusable element announced..</p>
