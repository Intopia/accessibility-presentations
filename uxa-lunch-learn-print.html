            <p>Ideally, inclusion would involve <b>co-creation</b> - the collaborative development of concepts and solutions with experts and these key audiences.</p>

            <p>This is especially important if you are after people's <b>lived experiences</b>.</p>

            <p>At Intopia, we focus on a subset of inclusion - <b>accessibility and disabilities</b>. This includes:</p>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>Normally, we focus on asking people:</p>
