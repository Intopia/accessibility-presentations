4. Mary and right-aligned buttons

Problem
Mary was presented with an email containing a long list of upcoming events. She was asked to find and book a specific event. However, all booking buttons were right-aligned, so it took her a long time to discover the relevant one.

Result
The task took much longer and created frustration.

Take aways

For left-to-right languages, left-align important information.

Background
Judith has cerebral palsy and no hand movement. She uses a head pointer to interact with the keyboard.

Problem
On a complex site, Judith needed to navigate to content within the page, but there was no skip link. This meant she had to tab hundreds of times to get to the desired content.

Result
Judith was forced to tab excessively just to reach the right section.

Take aways

Use skip links to allow users to bypass repeated content blocks.

Problem

Result
Judith could not tell when focus was on links or buttons and was unable to use the site.
