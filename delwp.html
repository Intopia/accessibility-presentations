          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>For this presentation, I&rsquo;m going to focus on the <b>testing aspect</b> of my work with UI components.</p>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>We will specifically focus on <b>&ldquo;accessibility unit testing&rdquo;</b>.</p>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>I found that by setting up a rigorous testing process, I was able to <b>confidently define the accessibility of each component</b>.</p>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>As you will see, the testing process is <b>focussed around different types of users</b> and how they could interact with any component.</p>

            <p>Over time, I began presenting this framework to teams <b>before new components were designed or developed</b>.</p>

            <p>And this allowed teams to think about different types of users <b>during the design and development process</b>.</p>

            <h2>What is accessibility unit testing?</h2>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>Accessibility unit testing is a process where the tiniest parts of a component are <b>individually and independently evaluated</b>.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>The aim is to determine if all aspects of the component <b>meet the needs of people with disabilities</b>.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>Accessibility unit testing is typically conducted when <b>reviewing an existing component</b> within the Design System.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>Or when <b>reviewing a new component</b> to determine if it can be added to the Design System.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>So, how can you <b>systematically test components</b> to ensure they are accessible?</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>You can create <b>a series of tests</b> based on two concepts:</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>1. How all aspects of the component are <b>presented to users</b> - either on screen or via assistive technologies.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>2. How users should be able to <b>interact with a component</b> to complete a task.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>These tests must include <b>all possible happy and unhappy paths</b> associated with the component.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>A <b>happy path</b> is the error-free path users take to complete a task.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>An <b>unhappy path</b> is where users may encounter errors or issues that stop them from completing the task.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>Let&rsquo;s use an example of a <b>date picker</b>.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>A <b>high-level task</b> might be something like:</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <div class="text-example">
              <p>The user can successfully add a date using the date picker.</p>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>But <b>numerous small interactions</b> associated with this overall task should be tested.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>And there are <b>different methods that people use</b> to achieve these interactions - mouse, keyboard, assistive technologies etc.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>Each of these needs to be <b>defined as a test</b>.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>For example, what tests would be needed to determine if the date picker overlay <b>could be closed via keystrokes only</b>?</p>

            <div class="text-example">

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">

            </div>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>An unhappy path could be where the date-picker question is required, but the user <b>does not enter a date value</b> for the field.</p>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>What tests would be needed to <b>determine if users could identify the field as required</b>, before they decide whether to enter data or not?</p>
