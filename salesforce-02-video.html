            <h2>Accessible Video</h2>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>Video is a fantastic tool for <b>delivering information and holding user attention</b>.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>But when we create content that requires a particular sense to acquire information, such as hearing or vision, we need to <b>provide an alternative means of getting the same information</b>.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>Common media alternatives for videos include <b>captions, transcripts, and audio descriptions</b>. </p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>Providing alternative formats means a person can <b>choose the format that's right for them</b>.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>We also need to take some other design considerations, like <b>audio quality and visual clarity</b>, into consideration for accessibility.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <h3>Captions</h3>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>Captions are a <b>synchronized text version</b> of all audio information needed to understand content.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>Captions should contain <b>all spoken dialogue</b>, as well as all other important information such as relevant sounds (like a phone ringing) or music cues. </p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>As a best practice, <b>identifying changes in the current speaker</b> is also recommended.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>When <b>media is live</b>, captions are usually produced in real time by professional real time captioners.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>For pre-recorded content, there are <b>two types of captions</b>.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>The first is <b>closed captions</b>. These can be turned on and off by people who are watching the video. </p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>The second is <b>open captions</b>, which are burned into the media file and thus always on.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>We recommend <b>closed captions</b>, as they are more easily customisable and can be turned off by people who don’t need or want them. </p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>They are better for content that will be <b>translated into another language</b>, and can be used to create a transcript more easily.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>As well as people who are Deaf or hard of hearing, captions can <b>benefit a range of other people</b>. </p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>This can include people with audio processing delays, non-native speakers, and <b>people watching video with no sound</b>.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>Controls for turning captions on and off should be <b>easy to find and use</b> in the media player for all users. </p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>Ensure your media player controls pass colour contrast and <b>can be easily seen and understood</b>.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p><b>Test your media player</b> to make sure these controls are accessible by all inputs, such as keyboard and voice control, and remain available at all levels of zoom.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>Most videos featured on Salesforce have closed captions, which is <b>the recommended captioning method</b>. </p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>However, there are some videos which <b>use open captions</b>. This is less ideal.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>Example: videos on https://www.salesforce.com/plus all have closed captions.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>Problematic example: see open captions on ‘The AI Paradox’ video on https://www.salesforce.com/news/</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <h3>Transcripts</h3>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>A transcript is a <b>text version of audio and/or visual information</b> needed to understand content.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>It should contain <b>all spoken content</b>, as well as ideally any other audio or visual information required to understand the video. </p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>This might include the <b>sound of a phone ringing</b>, the description of a painting, or the transcription of text that appears on screen.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>Transcripts are useful for people who are <b>Deaf or hard of hearing, blind, Deafblind</b>, or who have cognitive or visual limitations.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>However, there are many more people <b>who will use transcripts</b>. </p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>These might include people short on time, people looking for a verbatim quote, or <b>people translating the video into another language</b>.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>When providing a transcript, we must ensure it is <b>located in close proximity</b> to the media it relates to, is labelled clearly, and is in an accessible format.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>And when a video has no sound, we should <b>identify this somewhere on the page</b> in close proximity to the video. </p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>That way, people will <b>know to look for the transcript</b> straight away if needed.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>For example, the Connections 2025 Keynote on Salesforce contains a transcript that can be accessed via the ‘Show Transcript’ button <b>located immediately after the ‘Search’ button</b> on the player.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>Example: The Connections 2025 Keynote video on Salesforce+ </p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <h3>Audio description</h3>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>An alternative to providing a description of visual information in a transcript is to <b>provide that description as an audio track</b>.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>This practice is usually called <b>audio description</b>. </p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>Audio description benefits <b>people who are blind or have reduced vision</b>, or who aren’t looking at the video for any reason.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>Audio description can be provided in <b>two ways</b>.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>The first method is an <b>audio narration</b>. </p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>A narrator will describe relevant visual information <b>in gaps in the video audio</b>. </p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>This is usually provided <b>as a separate audio track</b>, but may also be integrated into the main video, or provided as a separate video.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>We should let viewers know where and <b>how any separate audio description is available</b>, in close proximity to the video.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>The second method is to integrate audio description <b>into the video content</b>. </p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>For example, a presenter naturally describes what a viewer will see on screen, <b>as part of the presentation</b>. </p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>This means a separate audio track is <b>unnecessary</b>.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>For example, in this video, information appears on screen that is <b>not included in the audio</b>. </p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>Integrated audio description would be a simple method of ensuring this content is <b>available to all viewers</b>.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>Example: https://www.salesforce.com/plus/experience/connections_2025/series/connections_2025_highlights/episode/episode-s1e1 </p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>Notes: Opening could be improved with audio description.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <h3>Sign language translation</h3>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>You may also be asked to provide a <b>sign language translation</b>. </p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>This involves a sign language interpreter either included <b>as part of the video</b>, or as a small overlay on-screen.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>As a sign language interpreter <b>must be large enough to be seen</b>, ensure enough space in the frame is left for their inclusion if you know you will be providing this alternative.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>Keep in mind that sign language is <b>local</b>. </p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>An ASL (American Sign Language) interpretation for example <b>may not be usable in another country</b>.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>Salesforce includes <b>ASL translators at live major events</b>.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <h3>Other considerations</h3>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>As well as media alternatives, when creating video we need to keep <b>several audio and visual considerations in mind</b> for accessibility.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>For audio, we need to ensure all audio is <b>high quality</b> so it can be easily discerned.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>We want to ensure any <b>background music or noise is at a low decibel</b>, to help people with hearing or cognitive impairments to more easily understand the foreground audio. </p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>Background audio should preferably be at <b>least 20 decibels lower than foreground audio</b>, or able to be turned off.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>Any speech should be even-paced and clear, and should <b>use plain language</b>.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>For visual content, we need to <b>consider readability of text</b>, such as our font and font size.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>We must ensure any <b>colours used pass colour contrast</b>, and that we don’t use colour alone to convey meaning.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>For example, in this video, <b>appropriate contrast has been used</b> on all components that appear on screen.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>Example: https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/video/gen-z-ai-agent-financial-perspectives/</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>Notes: See 0:10 - appropriate contrast</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>It’s also important that we <b>avoid causing migraines and seizures</b>. </p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>Do not use <b>flashing or strobing content</b>, or warn viewers if this is included.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>When embedding videos, it is <b>not recommended that they autoplay</b>. </p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>This can delay and frustrate users who are using assistive technology, or who have cognitive disabilities. </p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>For example, there are <b>several autoplaying videos</b> on this Dreamforce page. </p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>While these videos can be paused, it would be <b>better to avoid autoplaying content in general</b>.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>Problematic example: there are several autoplaying videos on https://www.salesforce.com/dreamforce/ </p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>Accessible video <b>doesn’t just benefit people with disabilities</b>. </p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>Many people <b>watch video with the sound off</b>, in a second language, or while distracted and not looking at the screen.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>When reviewing your videos, ask yourself, <b>“Do I need all senses to understand what this video is about?” </b></p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>Particularly consider how someone with <b>no hearing or no vision watching your content</b> would experience it, and whether the alternatives provided meet their needs.</p>
