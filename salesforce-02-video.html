            <p>Video is a fantastic tool for delivering information and holding user attention.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>But when we create content that requires a particular sense to acquire information, such as hearing or vision, we need to provide an alternative means of getting the same information. </p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>Common media alternatives for videos include captions, transcripts, and audio descriptions. </p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>Providing alternative formats means a person can choose the format that's right for them. </p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>We also need to take some other design considerations, like audio quality and visual clarity, into consideration for accessibility.</p>

            <h3>Captions</h3>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>Captions are a synchronized text version of all audio information needed to understand content.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>Captions should contain all spoken dialogue, as well as all other important information such as relevant sounds (like a phone ringing) or music cues.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>When media is live, captions are produced in real time by professional real time captioners.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>For pre-recorded content, there are two types of captions. </p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>The first is closed captions. These can be turned on and off by people who are watching the video. </p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>The second is open captions, which are burned into the media file and thus always on. </p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>We recommend closed captions, as they are more easily customisable and can be turned off by people who don’t need or want them.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>As well as people who are Deaf or hard of hearing, captions can benefit a range of other people. </p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>This can include people with audio processing delays, non-native speakers, and people watching video with no sound.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>Controls for turning captions on and off should be easy to find and use in the media player for all users. </p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>Ensure your media player controls pass colour contrast and can be easily seen and understood. </p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>Test your media player to make sure these controls are accessible by all inputs, such as keyboard and voice control, and remain available at all levels of zoom. </p>

            <h3>Transcripts</h3>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>A transcript is a text version of audio and/or visual information needed to understand content. </p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>It should contain all spoken content, as well as ideally any other audio or visual information required to understand the video. </p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>This might include the sound of a phone ringing, the description of a painting, or the transcription of text that appears on screen.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>Transcripts are useful for people who are Deaf or hard of hearing, blind, Deafblind, or who have cognitive or visual limitations. </p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>However, there are many more people who will use transcripts.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>These might include people short on time, people looking for a verbatim quote, or people translating the video into another language.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>When providing a transcript, we must ensure it is located in close proximity to the media it relates to, is labelled clearly, and is in an accessible format.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>And when a video has no sound, we should identify this somewhere on the page in close proximity to the video.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>That way, people will know to look for the transcript straight away if needed.</p>
          </section>

            <h3>Audio description</h3>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>An alternative to providing a description of visual information in a transcript is to provide that description as an audio track.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>This practice is usually called audio description. </p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>Audio description benefits people who are blind or have reduced vision, or who aren’t looking at the video for any reason.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>Audio description can be provided in two ways.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>The first method is an audio narration.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>A narrator will describe relevant visual information in gaps in the video audio.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>This is usually provided as a separate audio track, but may also be integrated into the main video, or provided as a separate video. </p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>We should let viewers know where and how any separate audio description is available, in close proximity to the video.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>The second method is to integrate audio description into the video content.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>For example, a presenter naturally describes what a viewer will see on screen, as part of the presentation. </p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>This means a separate audio track is unnecessary.</p>
          </section>
        </section>

          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>This involves a sign language interpreter either included as part of the video, or as a small overlay on-screen.</p>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>Sign language interpreters must be large enough to be seen.</p>

            <p>Ensure enough space in the frame is left for their inclusion if you know you will be providing this alternative.</p>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>Keep in mind that sign language is local. </p>

            <p>An ASL (American Sign Language) interpretation for example may not be usable in another country.</p>

          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>As well as media alternatives, when creating video we need to keep several audio and visual considerations in mind for accessibility.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>For audio, we need to ensure all audio is high quality so it can be easily discerned. </p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>We want to ensure any background music or noise is at a low decibel.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>This helps people with hearing or cognitive impairments to more easily understand the foreground audio. </p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>Background audio should preferably be at least 20 decibels lower than foreground audio, or able to be turned off.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>Any speech should be even-paced and clear, and should use plain language.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>For visual content, we need to consider readability of text, such as our font and font size.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>We must ensure any colours used pass colour contrast, and that we don’t use colour alone to convey meaning. </p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>It’s also important that we avoid causing migraines and seizures.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#EDEBEB">
            <p>Do not use flashing or strobing content, or warn viewers if this is included.</p>
          </section>

            <p>When reviewing your videos, ask yourself, “Do I need all senses to understand what this video is about?”.</p>
